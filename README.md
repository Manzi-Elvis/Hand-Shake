# 🤝 Handshake

> The future of collaborative work.  
> Docs. Boards. Chat. Real-time. Unified.

Handshake is a next-generation collaborative workspace that fuses the best ideas from **Notion**, **Trello**, and **Slack** into a single, cohesive platform — designed for **speed, clarity, scale, and real-time collaboration**.

This is not a clone.  
This is an upgrade.
